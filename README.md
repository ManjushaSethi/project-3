Chosen Track: Data Visualization
Chosen Topic: Healthcare (Covid-19 Vaccines)

# Potential Data Sources: 

- State-by-state data on COVID-19 vaccinations in the United States - Our World in Data 

- covid-19-data/public/data/vaccinations at master Â· owid/covid-19-data (github.com) 

- nytimes/covid-19-data: A repository of data on coronavirus cases and deaths in the U.S. (github.com)

# Exploratory Questions:
- How many people were vaccinated each month starting from Jan 1st 2021 - Jan 1st 2022 in each state? data
- How many vaccines were available per hundred people in each state? data
- What was the vaccine uptake rate in each age group by state? data
- How were different age groups impacted by the vaccine? data
- Total # of new cases after vax, total ICU/hospital admissions, death rate
- What is the impact of vaccination rate on new cases and mortality? (mortality rate before & after vaccine roll-out) data
- Did vaccination reduce the severity of cases (ICU Bed Occupancy) data

Project Statement: The aim of our project is to examine the effectiveness of vaccines using the Covid-19 vaccine as a case study. We will determine the success of Covid-19 vaccines  by looking at accessibility of vaccination by state, impact of the vaccination on different age groups by examining the number of new cases after the vaccine, total ICU/hospital admissions, and death rate over time.
