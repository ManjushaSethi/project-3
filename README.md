## Chosen Track: Data Engineering
## Chosen Topic: Healthcare (Covid-19 Vaccines)

## An overview of the project and its purpose

Project Statement: The aim of our project is to examine the effectiveness of vaccines using the Covid-19 vaccine as a case study. To create a database that can be used to examine the ongoing impact of Covid-19 vaccination on various included endpoints such as death and utilized to predict pattern of vaccine rollout and uptake for future epidemics. 

## Data Sources Used: 

- https://ourworldindata.org/us-states-vaccinations

- https://beta.healthdata.gov/Hospital/COVID-19-Reported-Patient-Impact-and-Hospital-Capa/g62h-syeh/data_preview


## Exploratory Questions:
- How many people were vaccinated each month starting from Jan 1st 2021 - Jan 1st 2022 in each state? 
- How many vaccines were available in each state? 

## Instructions on how to use and interact with the project

## External Library Used: Fast API
- To launch our Covid-19 Vaccination Database python application, please visit https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/ for installation documentation

## Documentation of the database used and why
- We used MongoDB for following reasons
- Faced with a large amount of data where fields may be incomplete, MongoDB is capable of parsing data quickly 
- Data  came from multiple sources while using different formats so NoSQL was an efficient way to store it.
- Data is dynamic so we needed flexible schemas to make changes as requirements might change. 
- Also as new data continuously need to be integrated NoSQL was chosen.

## ETL workflow with diagrams or ERD



## Ethical considerations made in the project
We tried to maintain our Ethichal Obligations while doing this project which are shown by following ethical considerations:

- 1. Transparency: We provided the source references. Our engineered data is on GitHub for open use.
- 2. Accountability: All the relevant data was included with consistency.
- 3. Privacy: No personal information was used.
- 4. Security:  Risks was mitigated while using Cloud MongoDB (no individual IP addresses, instead 00.00.00) .
- 5. Consent: Data used was from a open source. 
- 6. Integrity: Data was used from reliable sources.
